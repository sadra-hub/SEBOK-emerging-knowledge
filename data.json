Many electronic devices fail to work properly in the presence of strong RF fields. The disturbance may interrupt, obstruct, or otherwise degrade or limit the effective performance of the circuit. The source may be any object, artificial or natural, that carries rapidly changing electrical currents.\n\nElectromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is the ability of systems, equipment, and devices that utilize the electromagnetic spectrum to operate in their intended operational environments without suffering unacceptable degradation or causing unintentional degradation because of electromagnetic radiation or response. It involves the application of sound electromagnetic spectrum management; system, equipment, and device design configuration that ensures interference-free operation; and clear concepts and doctrines that maximize operational effectiveness (DAU 2010, Chapter 7).\nContents\n[3, SEBoK Electromagnetic Interference/Electromagnetic Compatibility]",

Functional, performance, non-functional, and constraint requirements are usually analyzed to determine functions and input-output flows. When functions are associated with system elements, the design definition process will need to determine if each system element has been sufficiently specified to build or buy it. If the system element must be further resolved in order to achieve this sufficiency then the functions associated with the system element will also need be further resolved and properly associated with the sub elements. Typically there are multiple ways to decompose the functions that contributes to the definition of multiple candidate architectures.\n[4, 15288, F3]",

(ISO/IEC/IEEE 2007)\n\nSEBoK Discussion\nThere are 8 definitions of attribute in the standards covered by the IEEE Systems and Software Vocabulary Project (sevocab). The included definition is the second, but best seems to capture the intended use of the term in SEBoK. Many uses of the term attribute are specific to database theory and formal modeling. See www.computer.org/sevocab for more detail.\nSEVOCAB contains the following note:\n[An] attribute can refer either to general characteristics such as reliability, maintainability, and usability or to specific features of a software product. ISO 9000 distinguishes two types of attributes: a permanent characteristic existing inherently in something; and an assigned characteristic of a product, process or system (e.g. the price of a product, the owner of a product). The assigned characteristic is not an inherent quality characteristic of that product, process or system. An attribute expresses some characteristic that is generally common to the instances of a class. The name of the attribute is the name of the role that the value class plays in describing the class, which may simply be the name of the value class (as long as using the value class name does not cause ambiguity).\n[3, SEBoK Glossary]",
